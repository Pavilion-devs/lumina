# Cluster 2 — Music Social

## Mission
Build a social music platform where fans engage with artists on Audius,
their social graph and activity lives onchain via Tapestry, and
loyal listeners earn points via an in-app rewards system.

## Bounties This Cluster Targets

| Bounty | Sponsor | Track |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Music | Audius | Empower artists/creators using Audius APIs & artist coins |
| Onchain Social | Tapestry | Social apps fully onchain via Tapestry protocol |

## Core Concept
- Audius SDK/API: fetch tracks, artists, engagement data
- Tapestry: onchain social graph — follows, likes, activity stored onchain
- Local rewards: points/leaderboard for engagement
- Result: focused execution for Audius + Tapestry tracks
